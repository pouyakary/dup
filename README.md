# dup
dup is a tiny and fast command line utility to find the duplicate files within a directory.

## Using it
Have yourself the Golang installed. On UNIX machines you can have the GNU Make and run the `make install`, on the windows, run a `go build dup` and put the `dup.exe` where you wish.

```
usage: dup [options] <directory>
  -h, help              displays this help message
  -q, quite    stops the software from displaying the results
  -r, remove   removes the duplicates from the directory
```
